    <string name="text">No humans have been to Mars yet; it remains a major goal for space agencies like NASA, with robotic missions paving the way for future crewed landings, potentially in the 2030s, but significant challenges like radiation, extreme cold, low gravity, and long travel times must be overcome. Current efforts focus on developing necessary technology and understanding Mars through robots, with plans like NASAs Artemis to the Moon serving as a stepping stone. </string>
